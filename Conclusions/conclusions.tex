% Possible to accurately estimate the origin of touch interactions. Dependent on scenario... background noise... temperature shifts... sampling rate... device size... microphone placement and type.

This thesis has explored two aspects of impact induced pulses in real-time audio streams. Firstly a functional view of pulses that aimed to localise impact sites of touch events solely based on the resulting pulses in the audio stream for primarily single-channel applications with a multi-channel extension. This application was referred to as acoustic pulse recognition (APR) and at its core relied on being able to distinguish some minute variations in transient pulses while accepting other variations. Factors such as background noise, tapping style, strength and apparatus and even environmental temperature was shown to have a significant effect on the pulse waveform, an effect that the algorithm would have to be able to deal with. A range of waveform matching algorithms were developed, tested and some applications were tested and hypothesised.
Secondly, the pulses were considered noise and a real-time single-channel detection and restoration system was constructed for a telecommunication application. Various detection algorithms were proposed and tested, but for the unsupervised generally applicable case some key observations about the noise pulses were the guiding principles of work: noise pulses were typically broad-spectrum events with rapid changing energy levels which formed the necessary contrast to speech signals. After successful detection the restoration stage was considered from a two-level perspective based on the pre-processing stage used for the application. A set of largely clean tonal atoms and the residual. Here the residual was considered as the primary focus for the array of restoration approaches trialled, but heuristic approaches were explored for the restoration of noise polluted tonal components as well. 

This brief concluding chapter proceeds by summing up relevant results from throughout the thesis whereafter overall conclusions are presented based on the aims set out in the introduction. Finally selected suggestions for future work are presented.

\section{Summary of results}
Results presented in chapters~\ref{ch:APR} and~\ref{ch:MultichannelAPR} indicate a false classification rate of less, and in some cases far less, than 10 \% in the ideal environment. Both the single- and multi-channel systems were negatively affected by coloured background noise, but the multi-channel system managed to retain a near perfect classification rate. Extending the single-channel PCA model to include the amplitude, or scale, of the pulse as a random parameter increased performance while computational complexity scaled linearly with $L$ number of scales introduced. $L=20$ scales were found to be sufficient above which no performance increase was detected. The PCA factorisation approach achieved a high degree of separability between components and $I=3$ was found to be an adequate number of components in relation to the component number's influence on performance, and template lengths of about 120 samples equally seemed to indicate the point of diminishing returns for the system.

Results from the detection algorithm was presented in chapter~\ref{ch:TransientNoiseDetection} where two wavelet based detectors were presented both showing similar or better performance characteristics than comparable methods from the literature with the added advantage of higher temporal resolution. A pre-processing stage was presented that took advantage of the tonality of speech which was shown to effectively separate speech and transient noise both audibly and visibly. The pre-processing stage also provided the basis for the two-level approach to restoration proposed in chapter~\ref{ch:TransientNoiseRestoration} where the tonal and residual components were treated separately, if at all necessary in the case of the tonal components. A variety of objective perceptual methods showed general modest improvements of 0.2 MOS and 0.4 for PEAQ for the selected sets which in subjective tests were not favored by listeners. Overall subjective tests also revealed a slight preference to the restored samples with huge variability in preference between different sets tested.

\section{Evaluation of results}
Work presented on the functional aspects of impact induced audio pulses have clearly shown that it is possible to implement a simple touch based user interface system using APR with only one active channel. Allowing for more computationally intensive methods (K-PCA) increased performance significantly in clean as well as noisy environment. Even the simpler univariate methods outperformed the random chance baseline by a margin. The more advanced PCA based method proved more resilient to the common variability in pulse waveforms associated with a variety of factors if these could be incorporated into the model during training while the simpler methods failed in this regard. A multi-channel extension/generalisation of APR further increased classification performance to near perfect levels with the testing data used and in the testing scenarios. 

The concept of a single-channel APR system has been proposed and clearly shown to be a possible and feasible solution to the problem of touch interactive user interfaces. Some key difficulties have been explored and to a large part tackled, such as variability in tapping styles and strength. 
%possibly more here though?

A noise pulse detection and restoration system for the telecommunication application was designed and realised. Tests show that a real-time unsupervised single-channel keyboard typing suppression system is viable both subjectively and objectively. The detection system performs similarly or better than state of the art alternatives using more limited approaches. The proposed method requires a minimum of look-ahead time and provides a much higher temporal resolution than alternative methods due to the application of the wavelet basis. The separation stage and the two-level restoration enables a scalable restoration approach with tonal restoration providing an additional line of restoration for keyboard pulses showing strong tonal components. The high temporal resolution would in particular be of utility in scenarios with corruption of far shorter extent such as clicks or transmission errors.

%The conclusion chapter should have a definitive introduction which draws the attention of the
%reader to the thesis statement upon which the research was conducted. The introduction
%should restate the research question that the study set out to answer and clearly justify the
%necessity of such a course. There is also the need to establish the context, background
%and/or importance of the topic. Conversely, this section must indicate a problem, controversy
%or a gap in the field of study. In doing this it is proper that the research questions are outlined
%and the key objectives of the study.
%
%Secondly, the introduction of the conclusion, just like those of the discussion chapters should
%provide a map of how the chapter has been structured. It should therefore provide a pictorial
%sequence of the issues to be discussed and how the section will end. This allows the
%examiner the opportunity to know what to expect and strong grounding for the research
%coverage.
