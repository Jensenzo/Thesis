%The conclusion chapter should have a definitive introduction which draws the attention of the
%reader to the thesis statement upon which the research was conducted. The introduction
%should restate the research question that the study set out to answer and clearly justify the
%necessity of such a course. There is also the need to establish the context, background
%and/or importance of the topic. Conversely, this section must indicate a problem, controversy
%or a gap in the field of study. In doing this it is proper that the research questions are outlined
%and the key objectives of the study.
%
%Secondly, the introduction of the conclusion, just like those of the discussion chapters should
%provide a map of how the chapter has been structured. It should therefore provide a pictorial
%sequence of the issues to be discussed and how the section will end. This allows the
%examiner the opportunity to know what to expect and strong grounding for the research
%coverage.
