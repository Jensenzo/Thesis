	Our process model consists of multiple pro-

	for information integration. The structure

	inference problem. There is not enough information to deduce the
	solution, so one must use any available information to infer the
	most probable solution. We demonstrate that source separation problems
	are well-suited for the Bayesian approach which provides a natural
	and logically consistent method by which one can incorporate prior
	knowledge to estimate the most probable solution given that knowledge.
	
	We derive the Bell-Sejnowski ICA algorithm from first principles,
	i.e. Bayes' Theorem and demonstrate how the Bayesian methodology
	makes explicit the underlying assumptions. We then further demonstrate
	the power of the Bayesian approach by deriving two separation algorithms
	that incorporate additional prior information. One algorithm separates
	signals that are known a priori to be decorrelated and the other
	utilizes information about the signal propagation through the medium
	from the sources to the detectors.},
