  abstract = {{Now available in a Fifth Edition, <B>An Introduction to the Psychology
	of Hearing</B> is the leading textbook in the field of auditory perceptionalso
	known as psychoacoustics. The Fifth Edition has been thoroughly updated,
	with more than 200 references to articles and books published since
	1996. The book describes the relationships between the characteristics
	of the sounds that enter the ear and the sensations that they produce.
	Wherever possible these relationships are specified in terms of the
	underlying mechanisms. In other words, the goal is to impart an understanding
	of what the auditory system does and how it works. Topics covered
	include the physics of sound, the physiology of the auditory system,
	frequency selectivity and masking, loudness perception, temporal
	analysis, pitch perception, sound localization, timbre perception,
	the perceptual organization of complex auditory "scenes", speech
	perception, and practical applications such as hearing aids, cochlear
	implants, and high-fidelity sound reproduction. The book starts from
	basic principles, and does not assume prior knowledge about hearing.
	Research results are not just described, but are interpreted and
	evaluated. The book includes extensive references to recent research
	so that those interested in a specific area can readily obtain more
	detailed information.<br><br>Designed for advanced undergraduate
	and graduate level courses in psychology, speech and hearing sciences,
	and audiology<br><br>Will appeal to researchers and professionals
	involved in sound and hearing, such as audio engineers, otologists,
	hearing-aid designers, audiologists, and hearing aid dispensers<br><br>Emphasis
	on the mechanisms underlying auditory perception with key concepts
	clearly explained}},
