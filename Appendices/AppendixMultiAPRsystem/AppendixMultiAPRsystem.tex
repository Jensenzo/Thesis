As seen in Figure~\ref{fig:MultiAPRsystem.pdf}, on page~\pageref{fig:MultiAPRsystem.pdf}, and Figure~\ref{fig:wholesystem} the multichannel APR system was constructed of a block of medium-density fibreboard wood $30.6 \times 24.3 \times 1.8$ cm (l$\times$w$\times$d), with 6 1cm diameter 2 cm deep holes drilled into it from the back. On the front of the surface a grid was marked out and 9 points were marked out. These 9 spots can be seen as squares drawn in pencil on Figure~\ref{fig:frontfacesurface}.

Microphone 1, seen in Figures~\ref{fig:mic1} and \ref{fig:wholesystem}, was an Oktava MK-319 large diaphragm condenser microphone. This microphone was positioned slightly above and outside the edge of the surface. Figure~\ref{fig:mic23}(a) and (b) shows microphones 2 and 3, respectively. These were DPA 4060 miniature condenser microphones. All microphones were omnidirectional with no padding or equalizing applied. As noted in Figure~\ref{fig:mic23}(a) and (b) microphones 2 and 3 were positioned into the drilled holes in the back of the surface and held in place with low density foam.

The AD converters used was an RME Firface 800 and can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:wholesystem}. All data was sampled at 48 kHz at 16 bit.

\section{Impulse alignment test}\label{sec:MultiAPRsystemAligntest}
While the application presented in chapter~\ref{ch:MultichannelAPR} only requires a consistent time alignment between channels, the phase speed calculations of appendix~\ref{ap:SpeedCalc} does rest on the assumption of absolutely aligned channels. To verify this assumption the three microphones were spatially aligned in an open space, as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:micsaligned}, and a sharp impulse, via a forceful hand clap, was applied approximately 4 meters away. The waveform for the impulse onset is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:micsalignedOnset}. Assuming a speed of sound in air at $20\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ $c = 343 \mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$. For a signal sampled at 48000 Hz, this gives a ``sample distance'' of about 7 mm.

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:micsalignedOnset} shows a feasible perfect alignment given the differences inherent in the microphones. Microphones 2 and 3 are identical with a symmetric placement on the the outside of Microphone 1. The sampled signals appear perfectly aligned.
